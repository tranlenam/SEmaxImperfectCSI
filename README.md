This capsule contains the code for the following scientific paper:

Quang-Doanh Vu, Le-Nam Tran, and Markku Juntti, "On Spectral Efficiency for Multiuser MISO Systems under Imperfect Channel Information," IEEE Trans. Veh. Technol., vol. 70. no. 2, pp. 1946-1951, Feb. 2021.

## Instructions
The "**convergence_mosek_Upload.m**" script makes use of [MOSEK](https://www.mosek.com/) as a convex conic solver to solve problems (10) or (11) in the paper. When clicking "Reproducible Run" on the top right corner, Code Ocean automatically downloads and installs these packages for you (see the "postIntall" file under the environment folder). If you download the code and run it in your machine, then you need to manually install MOSEK yourself.
